========  Here are some notes around updating the memory addresses for this app yourself!  ==========
=====================================================================================================

I assume you have CheatEngine, and you are not completely new to the tool.

The only thing that will requires updating each patch (typically) is only the offset to the Camera address.
We can find the Camera offset by locating your current zoom level, finding what accesses that address.

Process Overview:
  1.) Zoom your camera out to max level without something obstructing it.
  2.) New scan for an exact FLOAT value of 20.0 (current default max)
  3.) Go in-game and zoom in the closest you can WITHOUT going first-person.
  4.) Do a next scan for an exact FLOAT value of 1.5 (current default min)
  5.) Repeat steps 2 - 4 as needed until you are left an address that, when scrolling in and out in-game, goes down and up respectively between the values 1.5 and 20.0
  6.) Once you have the 'current zoom' address, find what accesses that address and you should find a static pointer (green address).
  7.) The NEW camera offset that you will Update the Memory-Addresses.txt file with will be the value in that static pointer's address: [ffxiv.exe+{value}]
  8.) To update the memory address for all to us, go to this github project, click the 'Memory-Addresses.txt' file on the root of the project, and click the 'edit' pencil icon in the top right.
     There,  modify the CameraAddress line to the NEW address as found through the process above.
     You should also modify the 'last confirmed working date' to the day's date (plus any other information on that same line is supported)
  9.) Commit and save the changes to the file.  Immediately after, create a "PULL REQUEST" on the next page and it will alert me to merge your fix. 
      If you are confident your memory fix works, I will merge them. If any of you reading this are Github savvy and wish to take over moderating pull requests, let me know.
  
If you absolutely WANT this app to be working, and absolutely CAN NOT do this, email me and I'll step you through the process in 10 minutes.
  
Cheers all,
